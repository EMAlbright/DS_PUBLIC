# 🛠️ DataSmith

**DataSmith** is a powerful and flexible tool built to transform unstructured and structured data into structured JSON, then automatically generate API endpoints from it — all with minimal or no code. This repository is part of the larger **DataSmith** initiative, and will be **periodically updated** as development continues.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of DataSmith is to empower individuals, small businesses, and developers to:

- Upload raw data (text, CSV, Excel, PDF, scraped websites, HTML, and more)
- Convert that data into clean, structured JSON using AI/LLM inference
- Automatically generate API endpoints to access and share the structured data
- Monetize or distribute the generated APIs through a platform

Whether you're a non-technical user wanting to create a usable API from a spreadsheet, or a developer looking to automate data-driven backend generation, DataSmith aims to be your go-to tool.

## 🔧 What This Repo Contains

This public repository will include:

- Core logic for data processing and transformation
- Backend infrastructure for handling files and generating APIs
- Periodic updates and improvements as the platform evolves

## 📅 Updates

This is a **work in progress**. I will be **updating this repository periodically** as features are added, bugs are resolved, and the architecture improves.

## 🧠 Vision

Anyone — regardless of technical expertise — can:

- Upload data
- Turn it into a smart, queryable API
- Share or sell access instantly

That's the mission of DataSmith: **API creation without the engineering hassle**.
